# Invasive Species Removal Simulation
## 1. Overview
A simulation with analysis of various removal strategies of invasise plant species from a vulnerable area of land. 
Details about the goals of the simulation (and experimental results) may be found in [the paper](Optimizing_Invasive_Plant_Removal_Efforts.pdf)
 I wrote about this project.

## 2. Usage
The simulation side of this project was done in NetLogo 6.2.2, with experiments done in BehaviorSpace, 
a NetLogo tool. The analysis was done in Python with Jupyter Notebook, numpy, and matplotlib. 

This experiment is quite rough and bears only theoretical similarity to what an invasive plant removal effort may look like in the real world. 
With extreme fine tuning it may be possible to create a more realistic simulation. 

## 3. Inspiration
This project was inspired by the succesfful 2015 red 
mangrove [removal effort](https://malamahuleia.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/red-mangrove-invasive-species-action-plan_final.pdf) in Nawiliwili bay, Hawaii. 
More information can be found on the non-profit's website, [Malama Huleia](https://malamahuleia.org/)

## 4. Future Work
This project may be improved by fine-tuning the experiment:
- Adding complexity to growth patterns
- Creating a more realistic human removal effort (picking plants region by region)
- Accurately configuring the number of trees that should be allowed to exist per unit of area
- Accurately configuring how much "work" can be done by the "humans" removing the invasive plants
